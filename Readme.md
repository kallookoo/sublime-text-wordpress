**It will no longer be updated. If someone wants to keep updating it, contact me.**

Is a collection of the completions and some snippets for Sublime Text

### Completions List

| Type         | Completions |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Functions    | **2901**    |
| Actions      | **684**     |
| Filters      | **1640**    |
| Classes      | **404**     |
| Methods      | **3705**    |
| Constants    | **527**     |
| Capabilities | **125**     |

### How to use

* Use `wp-` for view some completions
* Use `add_action-` for view actions completions
* Use `add_filter-` for view filters completions
* Use functions, constants or classes names, for e.g. plugin_dir... for view completions
* Use `name_of_class-method_name` for view method completions. e.g `WP_Error-add` by default all Classes wrap with sublime format completions
* Use `ctrl+space` or `alt+/` in linux for call completions if tag `<?php` not is defined. e.g. for create plugin header in empty file.
* On some cause the first "tab" deletes all parameters instead of having to tab through each one:
	- First Tab --> Select all parameters
	- Each Tab There after --> Selects each individual parameter or block

### Another Informations

* More info inside of [wiki](https://github.com/kallookoo/sublime-text-wordpress/wiki) page.
* Deprecated Functions, Constants, Classes, Methods, Actions, Filters have been removed
* WordPress back compatibility files is not included, as support for PHP versions
* Actions or Filter add two version of the completion only this not is dynamic name

	#### Example of completion file for Hooks

	With dynamic name:

	```
		{
			"trigger": "add_action-load-{$page_hook}\tWP Action",
			"contents": "add_action( \"load-${1:\\{${2:\\$page_hook}\\}}\", ${3:\\$function_to_add}, ${4:10} );"
		},
	```
	Without dynamic name:

	```
		{
			"trigger": "add_action-init\tWP Action",
			"contents": "add_action( 'init', ${1:\\$function_to_add}, ${2:10} );"
		},
		{
			"trigger": "init\tWP Action Name",
			"contents": "init"
		},
	```

	- This first trigger use add_action- for get all actions and continue by name of the action, returns everything you need to create.
	- The second trigger simply use the name and return this name.

* Some snippet the last index if used to delete this comments
* If use Sublime Text before 3092 is possible what some snippet not working.
* If your problem with `alt+/` to show completions popup, set key bindings with `ctrl+space` by example.
